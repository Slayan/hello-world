# hello-world
Hello, my name is Slayan. I am trying to become the best web developer there is, kind of like Ash in Pokemon. I am very new to this community and hope to learn and build a better future for myself. Thank you for taking the time to read this, have a wonderful day.
I am a 24 year old who has worked in warehouse for almost 6 years. I just rescently moved into my own place about a month ago. My favorite color is pink and I am totally an animal-lover (but I am not vegan or vegetarian). I like to listen to all kinds of music. Anywhere from The Black Dahlia Murder to Taylor Swift.
